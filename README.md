# Hey there!
🏫  Welcome to Homer's GitHub! I'm a senior at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing degrees in Finance, Information Systems, and Computer Science. 

😊  Aside from school, I really enjoy creating side projects driven by various AI, Data Science technologies, cooking creative dishes (I never liked following a recipe), and hopping on runs or bike rides to explore new places. 

🌌  If you too spend time contemplating the metaphysical and always dare to embrace the unknown, feel free to reach out for anything at any point! We only meet because fate wills it so.
